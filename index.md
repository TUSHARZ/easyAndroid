## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/TUSHARZ/easyAndroid/edit/master/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/TUSHARZ/easyAndroid/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.

                                    A Brief





What are we doing here?..
We all are using android devices , and frankly its everywhere.
With the increase demonic use of android , our lives are partially dependent on android applications we see today..
So why not learn and try to enter this world

Why Android?..
Google Play Store is a  vast collection of Android Apps being published by Individuals as well as company .
Considering more or less these apps are now a part of our lives ..
So either you wanna Startup or be a corporate guy, this skill is gonna come in handy.

Am i Capable?..
So imagine how cool it will be if you are capable to develop these android apps on your own for your own needs and share it with the whole world..
Well this is what this blog is all about.
I have seen many of my friends trying to start with android app development , but 2 days later , they are done , so what do you think stops them. Are you going to suffer the same?..
Well Obviously it depends on person to person , but I find a correlation.
All those who stopped are basically not interested , but are willing to do it anyway because they it's cool, which it obviously is or they see someone close do the same, i will call it the "itch" effect, that means something just itches them to go for android.
Well that's not actually good , because you need to find you own destiny, rather than following someone other's..

Am i suffering from itching effect?..
Well that's your question to answer..


Anyway if you are sure that you are not suffering from the so called "itch" effect and ready to enter the world of android, i will help you in anyway possible.
So to get Started What do u need?.
Just a little warming up tips..
Well Since Android is a java based Operating System , therefore it is advisable that your java basics are clear.
Secondly Android UI is based on XML, So i recommend you to take a look into that too but that's not important as you will learn it with time anyway.
So that's all the pre-requistes to start developing your app.
I hope you like what i tried to explain,
See you again...


Since it is my first post i would like to introduce myself
I am a 3rd year B.Tech(IT) student
Working with android for almost 1.5 years now..
Not a startup guy
Recently i worked as a Senior Android Developer With Delhivery.
Hackathon Enthusiast and won a few too.
Machine Learning enthusiast.
